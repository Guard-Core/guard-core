Building Adapters
=================

What Is an Adapter?
-------------------

An adapter is a thin library that translates a web framework's native request/response types into the `GuardRequest` and `GuardResponse` protocols defined by `guard-core`. The adapter provides the glue between your framework (FastAPI, Flask, Django, or any other) and the security engine. All detection logic, rate limiting, IP management, behavioral tracking, cloud provider blocking, and pipeline orchestration live in `guard-core`. The adapter's only job is type translation and middleware wiring.

    ADAPTER --> CORE
```

Minimal Adapter Structure
-------------------------

A complete adapter package follows this layout:

```text
your-guard/
├── your_guard/
│   ├── __init__.py           # Public API exports
│   ├── middleware.py          # Framework middleware class
│   ├── request.py             # GuardRequest wrapper (if needed)
│   ├── response.py            # GuardResponse wrapper + factory
│   ├── utils.py               # Framework-specific utilities
│   ├── decorators/            # Re-export or extend guard-core decorators
│   │   └── __init__.py
│   ├── core/                  # Override or extend guard-core modules
│   │   ├── checks/
│   │   ├── responses/
│   │   ├── routing/
│   │   ├── bypass/
│   │   ├── behavioral/
│   │   ├── events/
│   │   ├── initialization/
│   │   └── validation/
│   └── handlers/              # Framework-specific handler overrides
├── tests/
├── pyproject.toml
└── setup.py
```

Not every directory is required. If `guard-core`'s default implementation works for your framework, you skip that module entirely. Most adapters only need:

- `middleware.py`
- `request.py` (or inline wrapper)
- `response.py` (or inline wrapper)

What You Must Implement
-----------------------

### 1. GuardRequest Wrapper

A class that wraps your framework's request object and exposes the `GuardRequest` protocol:

```python
from guard_core.protocols.request_protocol import GuardRequest
```

The protocol requires these properties and methods:

| Member | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `url_path` | `str` | Request path (e.g., `/api/users`) |
| `url_scheme` | `str` | `"http"` or `"https"` |
| `url_full` | `str` | Full URL including scheme, host, path |
| `url_replace_scheme(scheme)` | `str` | Return full URL with scheme replaced |
| `method` | `str` | HTTP method (`GET`, `POST`, etc.) |
| `client_host` | `str \| None` | Client IP address |
| `headers` | `GuardRequestHeaders` | Request headers |
| `query_params` | `Mapping[str, str]` | Query string parameters |
| `body()` | `async -> bytes` | Request body as bytes |
| `state` | `RequestState` | Mutable namespace for inter-check data |
| `scope` | `dict[str, object]` | ASGI-like scope dict consumed by the adapter to resolve the route and populate `request.state` (`guard_decorator`, `guard_route_id`, `guard_endpoint_id`, and `guard_route_unresolved` when matching fails). `guard-core` never reads `scope` itself, so an empty dict suffices, global-level `SecurityConfig` settings still apply |

### 2. GuardResponse Wrapper

A class wrapping your framework's response that exposes the `GuardResponse` protocol:

| Member | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `status_code` | `int` | HTTP status code |
| `headers` | `MutableMapping[str, str]` | Response headers (must be mutable) |
| `body` | `bytes \| None` | Response body |

### 3. GuardResponseFactory

A factory that creates framework-native responses through the `GuardResponseFactory` protocol:

| Method | Signature | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `create_response` | `(content: str, status_code: int) -> GuardResponse` | Plain text error response |
| `create_redirect_response` | `(url: str, status_code: int) -> GuardResponse` | HTTP redirect |

### 4. Middleware Class

The middleware class that plugs into your framework's middleware stack and orchestrates the guard-core pipeline. This is where you:

- Initialize `SecurityConfig`, handlers, and the security pipeline
- Intercept incoming requests
- Wrap framework objects into `GuardRequest`/`GuardResponse`
- Run the `SecurityCheckPipeline`
- Return framework-native responses

What You Get for Free
---------------------

Everything inside `guard-core` works out of the box once you implement the four components above:

- **A 17-check catalogue** executing in a defined pipeline order (emergency mode, HTTPS enforcement, IP security, cloud provider blocking, rate limiting, suspicious activity detection, and more), with each deployment building only the checks its `SecurityConfig` and registered routes can actually trigger -- see [Middleware Integration](middleware-integration.md#build-time-elimination) for what your adapter needs to expose to get that optimization
- **Attack detection engine** with pattern compilation, semantic analysis, anomaly detection, and performance monitoring
- **Rate limiting** with per-endpoint granularity, Redis-backed distributed counters, and Lua-script atomicity
- **IP ban management** with auto-ban thresholds, TTL-based expiry, and Redis persistence
- **Cloud provider IP blocking** for AWS, GCP, and Azure with automatic range refresh
- **Behavioral rule processing** for usage frequency tracking and `status:` return-pattern detection out of the box; `json:`/`regex:`/substring return-pattern rules additionally require `SecurityConfig.behavior_scan_response_body=True` and a `BoundedResponseBodyReader` implementation on your response wrapper -- see [GuardResponse](guard-response.md)
- **Security headers management** (HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
- **Event bus and metrics collection** for telemetry integration
- **Decorator system** for per-route configuration (`@guard.rate_limit()`, `@guard.require_ip()`, `@guard.block_clouds()`, etc.)
- **Dynamic rule management** via the Guard Agent platform
- **Passive mode** for logging without blocking
